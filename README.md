# Group 1 - digital shift book
(Kerstin Beckersj√ºrgen, Simona Aich, Arkin Cip, Mauritz Brand, Jakob Gassauer)

## Introduction
With our program we want to solve the urgent need of digitalization in the healthcare-industry. Our focus is to connect the shifts of caregivers efficiently, to make their hard work easier and the life of the eldery more livable.


## Technologies used
Java, Maven, SQLite

## Work method
During our project, we worked in a agile SCRUM-method. Therefore we used the [Kanban-Board](https://github.com/JakobGassauer/ATdIT_Group1/projects/1) of GitHub.
