(Kerstin Beckersj√ºrgen, Simona Aich, Arkin Cip, Mauritz Brand, Jakob Gassauer)


### Introduction
With our program we want to solve the urgent need of digitalization in the healthcare-industry. Our focus is to connect the shifts of caregivers efficiently, to make their hard work easier and the life of the eldery more livable.


### Technologies used
* Java 
* Maven 
* SQLite


### Work method
During our project, we worked with an agile SCRUM-method. Therefore we used the [Kanban-Board](https://github.com/JakobGassauer/ATdIT_Group1/projects/1) of GitHub.
